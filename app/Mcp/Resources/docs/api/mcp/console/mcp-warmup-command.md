# McpWarmupCommand

> Pre-populates the plain-class attribute-discovery cache (see McpServer::buildDiscoveryCache()) by building the SDK server once offline, so the first real `mcp:serve`/HTTP request in a freshly started process hits the file-backed cache instead of paying the filesystem-walk + reflection cost of `Mcp\\Capability\\Discovery\\Discoverer` itself.

Pre-populates the plain-class attribute-discovery cache (see [`McpServer::buildDiscoveryCache()`](/api/mcp/mcp-server/#builddiscoverycache)) by building the SDK server once offline, so the first real `mcp:serve`/HTTP request in a freshly started process hits the file-backed cache instead of paying the filesystem-walk + reflection cost of `Mcp\Capability\Discovery\Discoverer` itself.

A no-op (but still successful) when `mcp.discover_attributes` or `mcp.discovery_cache` is off -- nothing to warm.
