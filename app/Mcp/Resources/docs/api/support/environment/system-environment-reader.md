The real environment: `getenv()` first, then `$_ENV`.

`getenv()` alone is not the whole environment a modern app runs in. A dotenv loader -- vlucas/phpdotenv's default `createImmutable()`, for one -- populates `$_ENV` and `$_SERVER` and deliberately does *not* call `putenv()`, because `putenv()`/`getenv()` mutate process-global state that is not thread-safe. A reader that only asked `getenv()` would therefore answer "unset" for every variable such a bootstrap loaded, while answering correctly for the same variable set by a container runtime. Asking both makes the two indistinguishable to a caller, which is what they are to the deployment.

A real process variable wins over `$_ENV`: it is the one the platform set, and an immutable dotenv repository will not have overwritten it anyway. `$_SERVER` is deliberately not consulted even though dotenv writes there too -- under CGI and FastCGI it also carries the request (`HTTP_*`, `REQUEST_URI`, `QUERY_STRING`), and configuration must not be able to reach that. Anything dotenv puts in `$_SERVER` it puts in `$_ENV` as well.

Only a string in `$_ENV` counts: the superglobal mirrors an environment whose values are strings, and a caller has an interface promising `string|false` to honour. This is what the container binds [`EnvironmentReaderInterface`](/api/support/environment/environment-reader-interface/) to by default; nothing here is mockable, which is the point -- tests reach for a fake reader, `putenv()` or `$_ENV` instead of stubbing this class.
