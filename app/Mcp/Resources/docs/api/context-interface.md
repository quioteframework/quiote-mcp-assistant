# ContextInterface

> What a collaborator needs from the application context: which profile this execution belongs to, and a way to reach its services.

What a collaborator needs from the application context: which profile this execution belongs to, and a way to reach its services.

Two methods, where 3.2 declared seventeen. The accessors are gone deliberately: a class that needs the routing, the user or a service should say so in its constructor and let the container hand it over. Reaching them through the context works no matter what the class is, which is exactly the property that made every collaborator's real dependencies invisible.

The profile concept is genuinely useful -- web, console, a named profile -- and a container handle is the deliberate way out for the cases that cannot be wired statically, so neither is a smell to be removed. What is left is what the name actually means.

Type-hint this in new code. [`Context`](/api/context/) implements it, and the container resolves it to the request's context, so `__construct(private ContextInterface $context)` works.

The lifecycle -- initialize(), shutdown(), reset(), the instance registry -- was never here and still is not: it belongs to whoever owns the context, not to the services, actions and views handed one.
