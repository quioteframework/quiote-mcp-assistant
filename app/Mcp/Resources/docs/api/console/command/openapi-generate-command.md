# OpenapiGenerateCommand

> Writes an OpenAPI 3.1 description of the app, derived from the live routing service's route collection and each action's own validator declarations -- see OpenApiGenerator for what is and isn't derivable.

Writes an OpenAPI 3.1 description of the app, derived from the live routing service's route collection and each action's own validator declarations -- see [`OpenApiGenerator`](/api/openapi/open-api-generator/) for what is and isn't derivable.

Reads routes the same way `routes:list` does (whatever the configured Routing class returns, attribute- and file-declared alike), so the two never disagree about which routes exist.

Document metadata comes from `core.openapi.*` (see [`OpenApiOptions::fromConfig()`](/api/openapi/open-api-options/#fromconfig)); the options here override it per run, for a CI job that publishes one spec per server or per module.
