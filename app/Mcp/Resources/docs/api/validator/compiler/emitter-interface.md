A back-end that turns a format-independent ValidatorPlan into a committable/checkable PHP artifact (e.g.

FluentSourceEmitter). This is distinct from RuntimeDeclarationEmitter, which produces the declaration ValidatorConfigHandler wraps into its own cache-file header at request time -- that path has no need for the checksum/target-hint contract emitters here are built around, since it's never diffed or committed.

## Synopsis

`interface EmitterInterface`

|  |  |
|---|---|
| Implemented by | [`FluentSourceEmitter`](/api/validator/compiler/fluent-source-emitter/) |
| Since | `1.0.0` |
| Source | `Validator/Compiler/EmitterInterface.php` |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| [`emit(ValidatorPlan $plan): EmittedArtifact`](#emit) | Turns a validator plan into a PHP artifact. |

### emit()

`abstract public function emit(ValidatorPlan $plan): EmittedArtifact`

Turns a validator plan into a PHP artifact.

Implementations must be pure with respect to the filesystem: the artifact is returned, never written, so the caller decides between committing it and diffing it against what is already on disk. The same plan must always produce the same artifact, since the checksum carried on the artifact is what makes a --check comparison meaningful.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `$plan` | [`ValidatorPlan`](/api/validator/compiler/ir/validator-plan/) |  |

Returns [`EmittedArtifact`](/api/support/compiler/emitted-artifact/)
